Features of Java:
1) Platform Independent- because of the byte code functionality java is platform independent
2) Platform/Architectural Neutral- Memory allocation of variables in java is completely independent from the system's architecture and it will always allocate a constant amounht of memory on all the architecture.
3) Simple and Secure-Java is simple language for an experienced programmer because it follows the same heirarchy of C and Cpp.
	
	Reasons for security	
		-it does not support pointer
		-supports byte code
		-encryption standards
		-strictly typechecked
			int a=10.5; invalid in java(because of type mismatch) but valid in c,cpp
			int a=(int)10.5; valid in java
			
			
Garbage Collector:
Collects garbage value and helps it to free. It is a thread that will execute after the completion of any program and it will free up all the memory used by the program.


Exception Handling Mechanism:
A runtime error is called an exception and a mechanism that can handle exception is called exception handling mechanism.


Multi-threaded Language:
Thread is a light weight process(part of process) and capability of a system to execute multiple threads simultaneously is called as multi-threading.


Process:
