Features of Java:
1) Platform Independent- because of the byte code functionality java is platform independent
2) Platform/Architectural Neutral- Memory allocation of variables in java is completely independent from the system's architecture and it will always allocate a constant amounht of memory on all the architecture.
3) Simple and Secure-Java is simple language for an experienced programmer because it follows the same heirarchy of C and Cpp.
4) Robust	
	Reasons for security	
		-it does not support pointer
		-supports byte code
		-encryption standards
		-strictly typechecked
			int a=10.5; invalid in java(because of type mismatch) but valid in c,cpp
			int a=(int)10.5; valid in java
			
			
Garbage Collector:
Collects garbage value and helps it to free. It is a thread that will execute after the completion of any program and it will free up all the memory used by the program.


Exception Handling Mechanism:
A runtime error is called an exception and a mechanism that can handle exception is called exception handling mechanism.


Multi-threaded Language:
Thread is a light weight process(part of process) and capability of a system to execute multiple threads simultaneously is called as multi-threading.


Thread:
Small piece of process is called as thread.


* Java is Object Oriented Language:
1) Class-It is collection of variables and methods.It is also known as a user defined datatype.
2) Object-It is a runtime(real time)entity, it is also known as instance of the class and it has the authority to access any content of the class.
3) Abstraction/Encapsulation-Showing only essential features without showing any background detail is known as data abstraction.
							-Wrapping up of data in a single unit is called data encapsulation.
4) Inheritance-It is a property by which a class can aquire properties of another class.
5) Polymorphism-Single name,multiple functionality.
6) Dynamic Binding-Run time memory allocation.
7) Message Passing-call by value and return by value.


DataTypes:
All those predefined keywords by which we can specify type of a variable or data are called datatypes. Declaration of a variable means we are going to reserve some memory spacein the system to hold a particular value.
